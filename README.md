**About Pens and Printers**

Pens and Printers was founded in 1984 and provides high quality office products to large
organizations. We are a trusted provider of everything from pens and notebooks to desk
chairs and monitors. We don’t produce our own products but sell those made by other
companies.
We have built long lasting relationships with our customers and they trust us to provide them
with the best products for them. As the way in which consumers buy products is changing,
our sales tactics have to change too. Launching a new product line is expensive and we need
to make sure we are using the best techniques to sell the new product effectively. The best
approach may vary for each new product so we need to learn quickly what works and what
doesn’t.

**Definition of a Metric for the Business to Monitor**

To help Pens and Printers effectively monitor the performance of their sales methods for the new
product line, a key metric can be defined based on efficiency and profitability. This metric should
reflect both the revenue generated and the time/effort invested in each sales method.
**How Should the Business Monitor This Metric?**

**Track Revenue and Time Spent Weekly:**

Weekly Monitoring: Track both the total revenue generated by each sales method and the total time spent by the sales team on that method.
Efficiency Comparison: Compare the revenue per minute across methods to see if more timeintensive methods yield proportionally higher return.
